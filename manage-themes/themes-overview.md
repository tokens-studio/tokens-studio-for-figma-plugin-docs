# Themes (pro)

## Themes (pro)

In software and web development, a Theme defines the styling choices applied to the graphic elements of an interface, influencing the appearance and atmosphere of websites and software applications within a specific context, such as a brand, platform, or user preference.&#x20;

When you are working with Design Tokens, the concept of theming enables you to style the same components in different ways so you can do more without needing to manage more components.

For example, instead of having 2 button components, light-mode button and dark-mode button, you have a single button component that takes on the styling properties of the color mode theme that is currently active.&#x20;



The Themes feature in Tokens Studio allow you to define combinations of Token Sets that are intended to be applied together to style design elements. Under the hood, the Plugin creates a themes configuration file that can be shared with developers and used in code.&#x20;

Multiple Themes can be applied at the same time to create a matrix of possible concepts that a single design element can be styled with. This is also known as _multi-dimensional theming_.&#x20;
