### Transforming Themes for use in Code

As soon as your Token project includes Themes, there are JSON files created by the plugin to save your configuration data so it can be shared with developers. Once developers have the new Themes files in your external storage provider, they can use that data in their transformation process to turn the themes file into usable code.&#x20;

SD-Transforms generic package includes a specific transforms to convert Tokens Studio themes into individual theme files for all possible permutations

#### Plugin Sync Settings

If this is the first time you are working with Themes in your project, theres a couple things you'll want to do in the Plugin Settings make the transformation process as simple as possible:&#x20;

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sync to a remote storage provider, like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Azure DevOps.</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/cardHeader-sync-remote-overview.png">cardHeader-sync-remote-overview.png</a></td><td><a href="../token-storage/remote/">remote</a></td></tr><tr><td>Configure your sync settings to save to a folder in your repository with multiple files. </td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/cardHeader-sync-remote-multi-file.png">cardHeader-sync-remote-multi-file.png</a></td><td><a href="../token-storage/remote-multi-file-sync.md">remote-multi-file-sync.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
