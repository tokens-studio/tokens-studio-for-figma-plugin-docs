title: Forced References
---

However, like all Token Types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the Token Name between curly brackets.&#x20;

For example `{token.name.here}`

{% hint style="info" %}
The value will show a broken reference until the originating Token Set is marked as enabled.
{% endhint %}

{% endcontent-ref %}
