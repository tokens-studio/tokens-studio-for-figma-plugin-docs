title: Font Family + Weight Pair
---

{% hint style="info" %}
Font Family and Font Weight Tokens work as a pair in Figma.

Figma's unique approach to combining Font Weight and Style as a single property written as a string value requires an exact match to the Font Family it is paired with.&#x20;

This means you must apply both Font Family and Font Weight Tokens at the same time to interact with Figma's text properties and see a visual change.
