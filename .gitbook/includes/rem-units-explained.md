title: Rem Units Explained
---

**Rem Units** act as a multiplier of the **base font size**, so when a user changes their preferences to a larger font size or uses a zoom feature in your product, elements defined in **rem units** will respond accordingly.

The value of `1rem` can be configured in the [plugin settings for Base Font Size](../../manage-settings/base-font-size.md).
