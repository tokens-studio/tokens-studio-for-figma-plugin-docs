### Transforming Tokens&#x20;

Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary.

The various Token Types supported by Tokens Studio have unique transforms to be aware of.
