title: Variable theme switching limitation

### Theme switching in the plugin won't work

Once you Export to Figma as Variables using Themes, you will be required to use Figma's native Mode Switching feature.

The Theme Switcher in the Plugin will not work once those themes are attached to a Variable Collection.
