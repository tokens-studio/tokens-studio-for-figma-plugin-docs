# Typography - Composite

## Typography - Token Type

Style text elements by composing many typography-related design decisions together into a single Typography Token.

Each of the nine design decisions (font size, letter spacing, etc.) that is part of the Composite Token is referred to as a **property** of the Typography Token in out guides.

***



### Design decisions&#x20;

Typography Tokens define a group of properties used to style text elements.

[In CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals), this is known as the `Text and Font Styling` properties, which are defined individually.



Typography Tokens can be applied to text layers to define all styling decisions in a single token.

Each property composed to style text elements can be defined as it's own Token and referenced within the Typography Composite Toke&#x6E;**:**

1. Font family
2. Font weight&#x20;
3. Font size&#x20;
4. Line height
5. Letter spacing&#x20;
6. Paragraph indent&#x20;
7. Paragraph spacing
8. Text decoration
9. Text case



<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p></p><p>Typography Tokens can be attached to Text Styles in Figma. </p></td><td><a href="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-figma-styles.png">card-header-figma-styles.png</a></td><td><a href="../../../figma/export/">export</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

***



### Possible values

Like all Composite Tokens, you define the value of each **property** individually. \
\
When you create the Typography Token in the plugin, you can reference each Token you've already created as a **property** or enter a hard-coded value.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best practice is to define all parts of a Composite Token, even with a `null/none` value, rather than to leave it empty.
{% endhint %}



#### Hard coded values

The dedicated Token Type of each **property** within the Typography Composite Token has unique specifications, described in detail in their own guides.



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Font Family

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-font-family (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">

Font Family defines the typeface.&#x20;

* It must be written as a string value that exactly matches how Figma has it written in their UI.&#x20;
* It acts as a _'pair'_ with Font Weight due to Figma's unique approach to text styling.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Font Family Guide_](font-family.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Font Weight

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-font-weight.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Font Weight defines the thickness and styling of the characters of a typeface.&#x20;

* It can be written as a unitless number, or a string value that exactly matches how Figma has written it their UI for the particular typeface.&#x20;
* It acts as a _'pair'_ with Font Family due to Figma's unique approach to text styling.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Font Weight Guide_](font-weight.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Font Size

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-font-size.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Font Size defines the height of the glyphs/characters of a typeface.

* It should be written as a numeric value with a unit of measurement in either pixels or rem.&#x20;
* Font Size impacts the Line Height and Letter Spacing values.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Font Size Guide_](font-size.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Line Height

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-line-height.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Line Height defines the vertical distance of each line of text related to its font size.&#x20;

* It should be written as a numeric value with a percentage to support responsive design in Figma.&#x20;
* Values without a percentage unit will be assumed as a fixed value in pixels.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Line Height Guide_](line-height.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Letter Spacing

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-letter-spacing.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Letter Spacing defines the horizontal distance between each glyph/character related to its font size.&#x20;

* It should be written as a numeric value with a percentage to support responsive design in Figma.&#x20;
* Values without a percentage unit will be assumed as a fixed value in pixels.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Letter Spacing Guide_](letter-spacing.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Paragraph Spacing

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-paragraph-spacing.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Paragraph Spacing defines the vertical distance between 2 paragraphs of text&#x20;

* It should be written as a numeric value with a unit of measurement in either pixels or rem.&#x20;
* Values without a unit will be assumed as a fixed value in pixels.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Paragraph Spacing Guide_](paragraph-spacing.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Paragraph Indent

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-paragraph-indent.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Paragraph Indent defines an offset of the first word of every paragraph.

* It should be written as a numeric value with a unit of measurement in either pixels or rem.&#x20;
* Values without a unit will be assumed as a fixed value in pixels.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Paragraph Indent Guide_](paragraph-indent.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Text Decoration

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-text-decoration.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Text Decoration defines the position of an optional line in a string of text.&#x20;

* It should be written as the string value that matches the intended property.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Text Decoration Guide_](text-decoration.md)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Text Case

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/card-header-token-type-text-case.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Text Case defines a transformation to the capitalization of letters in a string of text.&#x20;

* It should be written as the string value that matches the intended property.&#x20;

[_â†’ Jump to the Text Case Guide_](text-case.md)
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Any property defined within the Typography Token that accepts numeric values can use math to calculate their value in Tokens Studio.&#x20;

_There's an example in the image below for Line Height and Letter Spacing to convert a unitless number into a percentage to accommodate Figma's limitations on those properties._&#x20;

[â†’ Jump to the guide on Tokens with Math Values for more details.](../../token-values/math.md)
{% endhint %}



### Values that reference another Token

Like all Composite Tokens, you may reference an existing Token as the value for each individual property [as described above â†‘](./#hard-coded-values).

If you'd prefer to reference an existing Typography Composite Token as the value instead of defining each Property, select the Token's Reference mode button (2x2 circle icon).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/tokens-typography-form-references-both-2-01.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Once the Typography Token form is open, you can select the icon button to reference a Typography composite Token as the value. </p></figcaption></figure>



When trying to reference another Token as the Value for a Typography Token, you will see Tokens in the dropdown list that are:

* Living in Token Sets that are currently **active**.
  * In the left menu on the plugin's Tokens page, **a checkmark is visible next to the Token Set name**.
* Token Type is compatible:
  * `typography`

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/forced-references.md" %}

***



### Apply Typography Tokens

**Typography Tokens** define all 9 styling properties of text when the Token is applied.&#x20;

With one or more text layers selected in Figma, click on the name of a Typography Token in the Plugin to instantly apply its value.&#x20;



Keep in mind, Tokens can only be applied to the entire layer. In the case of Typography, you might want to apply a Token to a particular word within the text layer, but that is not possible today due to limitations of the Figma plugin API.

### Text Styles in Figma

Typography Tokens can be [Exported to Figma as Text Styles](../../../figma/export/)**.** Tokens Studio also supports [Styles with Variable References](../../../figma/export/styles-variable-references.md).

Here are some tips for creating Text Styles with Variable References using the Plugin.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you export your Typography Tokens to Figma as styles, ensure each property within the **Typography Tokens has a value referencing another Token**.
{% endhint %}

When you **Export to Figma**, select these **Options** from the menu:

* `Typography Styles` is selected.
* `Number` and `String Variables` are selected.
* `Create styles with variable references` is selected.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/tokens-typography-export-stylesvar-ref-2-01.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select the Export Styles and Variables from the Tokens page to configure the Options. </p></figcaption></figure>



Ensure your Export to Figma as Themes or Sets configuration includes all necessary Tokens.

* Themes and token sets where the referenced Tokens are located are `active`.
* Themes and token sets where the variables are attached may need to be configured as `reference only`.



You'll notice these Variables are created on Export based on their Token Type:

* `fontFamily` (will create as string variable)
* `fontWeight` (will create either as string or number variable, depending on if they are a string or a number)
* `letterSpacing` (number variable)
* `lineHeight` (number variable)
* `paragraphSpacing` (number variable)
* `paragraphIndent` (number variable)

You'll notice the Text Style will be created on Export, with all possible values mapped to the appropriate Variables, based on the Token Type for each property.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Tokens using percentage units `%`, the plugin will not map this property to the variable created to preserve the responsive design decision in the token.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Variables-Skipped-percentage-typography-V2-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Text Style created with Variable References from the Plugin will leave properties with percentage values attached to the Token value and not a variable. The remaining text properties will be attached to Variables. </p></figcaption></figure>



{% hint style="warning" %}
Known issue with Font Weight as Figma doesn't allow changing a Variable Type after its been created.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you are converting your [Font Weight Tokens](font-weight.md#possible-values) between numeric and string values and you've already exported to Figma as a Style with Variable References, you may need to delete the Variable from the Figma collection.&#x20;

Figma doesn't allow the changing of a Variable type, so by deleting that single Variable in Figma, when you export the Typography Token as a Style with Variable References, the Plugin will create the variable with the new Token Type.&#x20;

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/export-to-figma-guide.md" %}

***



### W3C DTCG Token Format

`typography` is an official token type in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.([9.7 Typography ](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#typography))

However, Tokens Studio has approached Typography Tokens differently than how it is defined in the current spec draft. We support:

* Additional text properties not defined in the spec.
* Dedicated Token Types for each text property.

We've made these adjustments in the plugin to align with Figma's unique approach to Typography.

***



### Transforming Tokens

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/transform-tokens-default-message.md" %}

When transforming Typography Tokens, which are a Composite Token with several adaptations to accommodate Figma's unique approach to Text Styling, there are specific configurations to be aware of.



**Composite Tokens** require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/object-object-typography.md" %}



If you are working in **Android Compose**, there is an optional transform to convert `typography objects` into Android Compose shorthand (platform option).

[â†’ SD-Transforms Read Me Doc, ts/typography/compose/shorthand](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#options)



Each property defined within the Typography Token has individual SD-Transform configurations to be aware of, which can all be found on the [Read Me page on Github.](https://github.com/tokens-studio/sd-transforms/blob/main/README.md)
