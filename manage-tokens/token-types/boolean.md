# Boolean

## Boolean - Token Type

Boolean Tokens define layer visibility of an element as true or false.&#x20;

It does not control component properties, as Figma doesn't allow it.

***



### Design decisions

Boolean Tokens are great for hiding or showing layers that may be visible within a component under certain conditions.

For example, a card with some actions that are only visible once the card has been interacted with.

You could create two Boolean Tokens:

* `card.show-actions.default` with a value as `false`.
* `card.show-actions.interaction` with values as `true`.

Then, apply the Boolean Tokens to the Actions layer of each variation of the card design.



<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p></p><p>Boolean Tokens can be attached to Boolean Variables in Figma. </p></td><td><a href="broken-reference">Broken link</a></td><td><a href="../../figma/export/">export</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Possible values

The syntax used to write string values for Design Tokens is important, so be sure to write your Boolean Token value with **all lowercase letters and ensure there are no spaces**.&#x20;

#### Hardcoded string values

There are only two possible values for the Boolean Token:

* `true`
  * The layer is visible.
* `false`
  * The layer is not visible.



### Values that reference another Token

When trying to reference another Token as the Value for a Boolean Token, you will see Tokens in the dropdown list that are:

* Living in Token Sets that are currently active.
  * In the left menu on the plugin's Tokens page, **a checkmark is visible next to the Token Set name.**
* Token Type is compatible:
  * The same = `boolean`

### Apply Boolean Tokens&#x20;

&#x20;You can apply a Boolean Token to show or hide any design element and all of its children layers.&#x20;

With one or more elements selected in Figma, click on the name of your chosen Boolean Token in the Plugin to instantly apply its value.&#x20;

### W3C DTCG Token Format

`boolean` is not yet an official Token Type in the W3C DTCG specifications. Tokens Studio has added Boolean as a Token Type to support Figma's Boolean Variable.

### Transforming Tokens

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/transform-tokens-default-message.md" %}

When transforming Boolean Tokens, there are no specific configurations to be aware of.&#x20;

Running the SD-Transforms pre-processor as part of the generic package will prep your Boolean Tokens for Style Dictionary.
