# Multi-file Sync to Remote Storage (pro)

## Multi-file sync (pro) to remote Token Storage

> The **Multi-file sync to remote storage** feature requires a [Pro Licence](https://tokens.studio/pricing) for Tokens Studio. Read the guide for more details.&#x20;

The Multi-file sync feature allows you to sync your Token data to your remote Token storage provider in multiple JSON files, which live within a folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you use the **Themes (pro)** feature in Tokens Studio and your engineers consume your Tokens from GitHub, the transformation process requires Tokens stored in multiple files.

{% endhint %}

### Sync provider settings

To set up **Multi-file sync**, follow the steps in the guide for your Git sync provider's **Folder** option of **Token Storage Location**.

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/git-sync-providers-cards.md" %}



When Tokens are stored in a folder

* Each **Token Set** created in the plugin is added to the folder as an individual JSON file.
* Additional data files generated by the plugin are added to the folder.&#x20;
  * For example, `Themes` configuration.

The following image shows the Github sync provider form with examples of the **Token storage location** as Folder and File paths. Your sync provider form may look different but the concept is the same.

If you have a Pro Licence for Tokens Studio, you can create a new folder from within the plugin, or sync to an existing folder in your repository with read and write capabilities in the plugin (when enabled).

If you have a Free Licence for Tokens Studio, you can not create a new folder in your repository but you can sync to an existing folder with read-only capabilities in the plugin.&#x20;



### Sharing multi-file sync with teammates

The **Multi-file sync** feature requires a pro Tokens Studio licence, so what happens if other members of your team have a free licence?

When they **Pull** in your Tokens saved in your remote storage in **Multi-file sync**, they will be limited to **read-only access** in the plugin.

Teammates with pro licences for Tokens Studio will have the same collaborative access you establish with your sync provider.

#### Read only for free licence holders

In **read-only** access to your Tokens, your teammates can:

* View Tokens and themes.
* Theme switch.
* Apply Tokens.
* Pull updates from your sync provider.

They can not:

* Edit Tokens or themes.
* Push to your sync provider.
* Export styles or variables to Figma or update their values.

This can be a great way to limit access to editing your Tokens and keep your licence costs down.
