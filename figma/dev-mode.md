# Dev Mode in Figma

## Dev Mode in Figma

Tokens Studio for Figma is integrated with Figma's [Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/), allowing developers to view and copy the names of Design Tokens applied with the Tokens Studio Plugin.&#x20;

[â†’ Read Figma's guide on Dev Mode for more details on this feature and their licence requirements.](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023124644247-Guide-to-Dev-Mode)



Once the Plugin is connected to your Dev Mode account, you can select `Tokens Studio` as a programming language option to view the data from the Plugin attached to the layers you are currently inspecting in Dev Mode.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This setting is saved to your Figma user account.&#x20;

This means each person on your team using Dev Mode will need to enable the Plugin from their individual Figma account.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



### Add Tokens Studio to Dev Mode

From any Figma file, toggle to Dev Mode using the action at the bottom toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut shift + D.

Use the search feature (underneath the Plugin tab) to look for `Tokens Studio for Figma`.

### Viewing Tokens Studio Data in Dev Mode

Once the Plugin has been saved to your Dev Mode account, you can view Design Tokens applied to design elements by the Tokens Studio Plugin.&#x20;

\
From any Figma file, toggle to Dev Mode using the action at the bottom toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut shift + D.

* Navigate to the Inspect Tab in Dev Mode.&#x20;
* Find the Programming Language selector and choose `Tokens Studio`.

The programming language select input is open, with Tokens Studio for Figma as the new option is highlighted. </p></figcaption></figure>

On the Figma canvas, select the specific layer you'd like to view.&#x20;

The names of any Tokens applied to that layer with the plugin will appear in the Dev Mode panel where code is displayed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Figma can only show Tokens applied to one layer at a time. \
To view any Tokens applied to children layers, you need to select those layers individually.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If desired, you can use Figma's copy button to capture all Token Names appearing in Dev Mode to your clipboard to you can paste them elsewhere.
